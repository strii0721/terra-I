# IMMORTAL OMNISSIAH, HEAR OUR PRAYERS.
# WE ARE YOUR CHILDREN, PIOUS SCHOLARS OF THE PATH OF THE MACHINE. 
# WE PRIZE KNOWLEDGE ABOVE ALL ELSE, FOR IT IS YOUR ETERNAL GIFT UPON MANKIND. 
# WE ASPIRE TO THE BLESSED FORM OF THE MACHINE, AND ASCENSION THROUGH TECHNOLOGY, THAT WE MIGHT EMULATE THINE GLORY. 
# SHELTERED BY STEEL, AND PROTECTED BY THINE AVATARS OF WAR, WE PLY THE STARS IN SEARCH OF YOUR LOST GIFTS TO OUR KIND.
# MACHINE GOD, WATCH OVER US IN OUR TRAVELS, SHIELD US WITH METAL AND LIGHTNING, FOR THE UNIVERSE IS AN UNCARING VOID, AND THE WARP HUNGERS FOR US ALL.
# TOLL THE GREAT BELL ONCE! PULL THE LEVER FORWARD TO ENGAGE THE PISTON AND PUMP.
# TOLL THE GREAT BELL TWICE! WITH PUSH OF BUTTON FIRE THE ENGINE AND SPARK TURBINE INTO LIFE.
# TOLL THE GREAT BELL THRICE! SING PRAISE TO THE GOD OF ALL MACHINES!
